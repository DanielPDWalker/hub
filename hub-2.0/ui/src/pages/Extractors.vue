            <p>Meltano lets you easily extract data out of arbitrary sources (databases, SaaS APIs, and file formats)
                using Singer taps, which take the role of your projectâ€™s extractor plugins. To learn more about
                extracting and loading data using Meltano, refer to the Data Integration (EL) guide.</p>
